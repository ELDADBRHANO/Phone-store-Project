          The path to success is not always easy – just ask aspiring
          entrepreneurs, and they will tell you the tiresome, persistent process
          that has kept them awake on many nights. As you continue to pursue
          your career dreams, reading up on some successful entrepreneurship
          stories can help boost morale, especially if you already have a
          business plan, have taken out a loan, and have found a space, and all
          you need is a boost of encouragement. After all, starting a business
          from scratch is one of the scariest things in the world. Instead of
          thinking about all the things that could go wrong, think about the
          things that could go right and how one day, your name could fall in
          the list of best entrepreneur stories. Of course, if you read up on
          any entrepreneurship success story, you will find that most successful
          businessmen have gone through their fair share of struggles. Many of
          them failed but continued to pursue their goals relentlessly.
          Remember, perseverance is the key to success. If you are just starting
          out your career, we understand that you may feel overwhelmed and may
          also want to quit. However, here are some successful entrepreneurs in
          the world and their stories to lift your spirits: MaryBeth Hyland-
          Founder of Spark Vision One of the most inspiring entrepreneur’s
          stories is of MaryBeth Hyland. She faced loads of abuse during her
          early life, which led her to question her self-worth. However, she
          delved into creating her own company, despite all her struggles. Spark
          Vision is a company that collaborates with other businesses and
          encourages them to maintain a collaborative office workplace, moving
          away from the toxic office culture. Hyland has excelled in millennial
          engagement as she aims for her business to help businesses build close
          bonds with their employees. Her survival is an inspiration for all of
          us, especially because she uses her past experiences to connect with
          people. Hyland believes that all the ugly things she went through in
          life have helped her succeed, creating a name for her in the list of
          top entrepreneurship success stories.

              Knowing employees strengthens the relationship between employees
              and their Bosses. Being rude to employees will not only demotivate
              them but also make you an unpopular member within the
              organization. Call them by their names rather than addressing as
              “Mr/Ms” or “Hey”, greet them with a smile and enquire what is
              going on in their personal lives once in a while and see the
              difference yourself. Trust me; you will be elated to see employees
              striving hard to accomplish assigned targets within the shortest
              possible time frame. Conflicts and misunderstandings lead to no
              solutions. Fights over petty issues not only lead to frustration
              but also spoil the ambience at the workplace. Do not forget that
              we are not school going kids who would fight over small things. It
              is essential to behave as mature professionals. Encourage healthy
              communication at workplace where employees get an opportunity to
              interact with each other, discuss ideas and also gain from each
              other’s expertise.

              Knowing employees plays a crucial role in motivating employees to
              deliver their level best. Knowing employees helps managers to
              understand their needs and expectations from the organization.
              Managers need to know whether their team members are happy with
              their jobs or not? Do not make your employees feel ignored or left
              out. Believe me; they would hardly contribute towards the
              organization. Unless and until they feel themselves indispensable
              for the organization, they would never take things seriously. In
              such cases, individuals attend office just to receive their
              monthly pay checks and treat work as a mere source of burden. Do
              you ever think of speaking ill of your family members, friends or
              relatives? Absolutely NO. Then why always criticize your BOSS? Why
              don’t we feel like coming to our office whereas we enjoy so much
              at homes? Have you ever asked yourself?

              Nilly Humpson, who has been responsible for creating ISF's
              children's Phones, is a writer, entrepreneur and former TV

              accomplished short story writer. Her latest collection, Twice

              which it is manifested in the characters' lives. Safia has also
              met with considerable success in business. She and her husband,
              Ian, founded A. Gold in Spitalfields, a delicatessen selling
              traditional British products; they have since gone on to found an
